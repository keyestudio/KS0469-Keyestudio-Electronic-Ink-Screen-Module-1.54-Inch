# KS0469 Keyestudio Electronic Ink Screen Module 1.54 Inch

![](media/wps10.png)

## 1. Description

When we do DIY experiments, we often need to use the display.

The Keyestudio E-screen module has a 1.54-inch display with a black and white color and a resolution of 200*200. The module dynamically displays the pattern via SPI communication.

For your convenience, we also provide detailed methods for using the display module and the arduino microcontroller. At the same time, in order to fix the module on other equipments, the module comes with 4 positioning holes with a diameter of 3mm. We also provide 4 pcs M3 * 10MM double-pass hex copper posts and 4pcs M3 * 6MM round head screws.

Special Note: When testing it, we use the 1.8.9 version of the IDE software, if you use other versions of the IDE, code may be incompatible.
